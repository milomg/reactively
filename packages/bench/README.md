A tool for benchmarking fine grained reactive frameworks.

```
$ pnpm bench
```
The output is in formatted csv format which you can read in the console
or feed into your favorite spreadsheet or dataviz tool.


# Features
* Configurable dependency graph: graph shape, density, read rate are all adjustable.
* Supports dynamic reactive nodes
* Framework agnostic. Simple API to test new reactive frameworks.
* Runs benchmarks under nodeJs for convenience and continuous integration.
* Optionally runs benchmarks in a browser for debugging (using cypress)
* Uses v8 intrinsics to warmup and cleanup
* Tracks garbage collection overhead per test
* Outputs a csv file for easy integration with other tools.

# Usage
Run benchmarks in node:
```
# warm up and then run each benchmark 8 times, reporting the fastest time. (default 5)
$ pnpm bench - --repeats 8

```

Run benchmarks in browser:

```
$ cd ../cypress
$ pnpm component-test
```
Note that benchmarks in the browser currently run once with no warmup, so the results are not
as stable.

# Creating new test configurations
1. Add an entry to the `TestConfig` list in `PerfConfigurations.ts`.

# Adding a new reactive library to the test suite
1. Implement a `ReactiveFramework` wrapper. See e.g. `SolidFramework.ts` or `PreactSignalFramework.ts`
2. List your framework wrapper as a `FrameworkInfo` in `PerfConfigurations.ts`
